# Hi!

I'm Michael Levy. I'm an aspiring software developer with a love for solving problems.

I'm currently a student at Victoria University of Wellington. There's a really solid ECS department here, and it's given me a great foundation in data structures, algorithms, project management, and many other skills integral to being a good developer. In my own time I've been working on my web development skills, as that's the area I'd most like to enter. This means working on projects where I can work on the tools and technologies that are important in the webdev space - but my interests remain broad, and I'm always open to trying new things.
